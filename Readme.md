# Tagger

A prototype for a laser tag system for use in RC.  Currently receive only.

Based on: https://github.com/afaucher/LazerTagHost

What works:
* Reading hits and taking damage.
* Tracking health.
* Player 'death'.
* Displaying hits (flash red), health (% green) & death (stay on white) on LED strip.

What doesn't work yet:
* Shooting
* Ammo tracking
* Dual LEDs, one for each wing.
* IR LED power amplification
* Configuring player / team via switches
* Powering via onboard battery
* All the above parts for mounting on a plane.
